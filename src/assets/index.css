/*
There are two ways to add custom CSS to Tailwind:
- To all layers with * {}
- With the layer directive (there are 3 layers: base, components, utilities)

## Base layer
If you want to add custom CSS styles to specific HTML elements,
add those styles to the base layer.

Example: if you want to style all H2 elements you use the base layer.

##Components layer
If you want to add custom CSS styles to our more complicated
classes, then add those styles to the components layer.

Example: card, button...

##Utilities layer
For css features you like to use in your project that the tailwind doesn't
include utitilies for by deafult.
