## Icons using [Iconify for Tailwind CSS](https://iconify.design/docs/icon-components/vue/)
Iconify offers native icon components for several popular UI frameworks.
One syntax for over 200,000 icons from 150+ icon sets.
Renders SVG.

Note! Installing the full package may increase the size of your application unnecessarily 
if you're only using a few icons from that package. When you install the full package, 
it includes all available icons, even if you're not using them in your project.
To optimize performance and reduce the size of your application, 
it's better to install only the icon sets that you actually need. 

Erik already added the material-symbols light by running the command 
`npm install --save-dev @iconify-json/material-symbols-light`
